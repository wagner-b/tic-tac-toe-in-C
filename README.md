# tic-tac-toe-in-C
This is a simple tic-tac-toe game (also known as noughts and crosses, or Xs and Os) written in C. This game runs on the terminal (or cmd). It is meant to be played by human player vs human player, the computer does not play.

I have included binary releases for Linux and Windows systems (for x86_64 CPU architecture). If that does not work for you, compile the program yourself. Compilation example: `gcc tic-tac-toe.c -o tic-tac-toe`.
